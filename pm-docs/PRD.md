Project title: Kliq's KliqFest Official Website
One-sentence goal of the website: Create a hub website for all things KliqFest, a soccer tournament and block party with food, art, and clothing vendors, among other organizations and sponsors.
3–5 core features (written as bullet points or user stories):
- There needs to be multiple forms for users to fill out depending on if they are looking to sponsor, sign a team up, or be a vendor/volunteer
- Allow the user to see different forms of media of the inaugural year while also providing a summary of the event for the user
- Have a means for users to reach out to me with questions or comments
- Have a way for the user to reach the Kliq Brand website from the festival page to buy merchandise

List of 4–6 intended pages (e.g., homepage, about, gallery, contact):
- Homepage
- About/Mission Page
- Sign Ups for vendors, teams, and volunteers
- Inaugural Year/Gallery
